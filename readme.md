## Scaling Strategy Overview

Explanation about how the system can scale efficiently from **5 RPS**  to **50 RPS** to  **500 RPS**, ensuring reliability and performance at each stage.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5 RPS â€“ Basic Setup
- **Single Server:** A single Node.js server connected to MySQL is sufficient.
- **Simple Setup:** Minimal infrastructure; no major optimizations required.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 50 RPS â€“ Moderate Traffic
- **Connection Pooling:** Reuse database connections to reduce overhead.
- **Redis Caching:** Cache frequently requested data to reduce database hits.
- **Process Management:** Use tools like **PM2** or **Docker** to run multiple instances.
- **Basic Load Balancing:** Use **Nginx** or similar to distribute incoming traffic.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 500 RPS â€“ High Load
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Deploy multiple server instances; load balance using a reverse proxy or cloud service.
- **Database Replication:** Use read replicas to offload read operations from the primary database.
- **Advanced Caching:** Implement Redis for high-volume, low-latency caching.
- **Async Processing:** Offload write-heavy or long-running tasks using message queues (e.g., **RabbitMQ**).
- **Auto-scaling:** Automatically scale instances based on traffic with cloud provider auto-scaling.

---

### Summary
These scaling strategies ensure the system remains performant, responsive, and cost-effective as demand grows. By progressively optimizing each layer of the stack, your infrastructure can smoothly evolve to meet increasing traffic.
